     Hello, my name is Christian Ecraela and I am from Ewa Beach, Hawaii. I am 16 years old and currently enrolled as a senior at James Campbell High School. In my free time I like to experiment with visual arts such as photography, videography, and painting. I plan to pursue a career in film and television and hope to work alongside a big name company. I enjoy playing basketball, spending time with my friends or family, and watching videos on YouTube that satisfy my curiosity.
